## Problem Title
AI-Powered Interview Evaluation System
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Ministry of Defence

## Idea
The Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence, is responsible for conducting interviews for both new recruitment and promotions of scientific personnel. Conducting interviews in a fair and unbiased manner is critical to identifying the right talent.

Description:

The interview process consists of:

1.Asking relevant questions based on the candidate’s expertise and job role.

2.Evaluating responses to assess the candidate’s suitability.

A key challenge is ensuring objectivity in both question selection and response evaluation. The proposed solution aims to provide an AI-based system that enhances the interview process by automating the selection of relevant questions and evaluating responses to generate quantifiable scores.
